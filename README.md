# Photo-Submission Web Application

This is a PHP based dynamic web application that allows users to upload photos and moderators to screen the photos (approve or reject). This site has two different user interfaces for the public and moderator logins. The project is designed and programmed by me from scratch including the back-end scripts and front-end UI components.

Highlight Functionalities: 

  Responsive Design (Touch Screen Friendly)

  Dynamic Server-Side PHP Scripts

  Search & Sort Gallery Options

  Multi-Selection

  Zip File Download

This site is currently being used by Mount Douglas Secondary School's Yearbook Administration to gather photos for their Editors. It is visited by thousands of students and faculty members each year. (School Reference: Lara Wear)
